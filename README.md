# Timings of Fasta and some Rasta variants in HElib, TFHE and Palisade
This repository conatins code for timing implementations of Fasta in HElib, and some Rasta variants in HElib, palisade and TFHE.  The code requires the resepctive FHE libraries (and NTL (and GMP)) to already be installed on the machine where it is run.  Otherwise, to run the timing experiments one only needs to compile the .cpp files in the various folders.  Note that the packed version of Rasta in HElib has a 329-bit block size in order to match the number of slots in a BGV ciphertext with m=30269, while all other implementations use the original 351-bit block size for six rounds.
